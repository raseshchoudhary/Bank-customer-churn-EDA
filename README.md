2The HR should properly scrutinize before hiring any graduates.

3.Good news!, the company has a boast worthy gender diversity.

4.Customers with lower available credit may be relying more heavily on their credit card to make purchases, which leads to higher utilization rates. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as a lower income or unexpected expenses that reduce available cash.

5.Most of our customers, earn below $40k.

6.The transaction frequency of existing customer is 4 time more than the attrited ones.

7.Blue card is being given to all the customers irrespective of age.

8.Platinum card is only given to middle aged customers.

9.Uneducated customers have more credit limit because they have a habit of taking loans for inconsequential purchases.

10.Customer age and months in book are positively correlated.
